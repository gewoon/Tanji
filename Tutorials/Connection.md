- **Step 4.** Now go back to Habbo, log in and go straight in to the hotel. Now Tanji will start replacing the client and connect.<br/>

# Troubleshooting
- **"Help! I get an error when I open Tanji."** <br/>
 - Update your .NET-Framework to 4.5, [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653 "link").
 - Remove your "Installed Modules" folder. (Copy modules you want to keep, first)

- **"Tanji isn't connecting!"** <br/>
 - Turn your firewall and anti-virus off.
 - Don't use any VPN-service or other proxy servers. (Also disable VPN extensions on Google Chrome if you have one installed)
 - Try an other browser.
